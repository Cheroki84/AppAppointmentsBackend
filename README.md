## Some working samples ‚öôÔ∏è
### User management 
#### signup
![](img/readme/signupHeroku.gif)

- The email and password have established requirements with **RegEx**. 
- If there is already an account registered with that email, notify the user to choose a different one.
- The password must have the following characteristics:
    - Between 8 and 16 characters
    - At least 1 number
    - At least 1 lowercase letter
    - At least 1 uppercase letters
    - At least 1 special character`
---
#### login

- If you enter a wrong email or password, the app launches a warning message.
- When the user registers, a token is generated.
---
#### logout
![](img/readme/logoutHeroku.gif)
- When the user logs out, the token is removed.
---

### Appointment management
#### newAppointment
![](img/readme/newAppointmentHeroku.gif)
- After logging in again, the user can request the appointment.
    - The appointment is generated automatically thanks to the use of **moment**.
---
#### getAppointments
![](img/readme/getAppointmentsHeroku.gif)
- The token_user of the appointments is the _id of the user. This is the same for all appointments of said user, thus allowing them to be displayed, as long as the user is logged in.

---
#### deleteAppointment
![](img/readme/deleteAppointmentHeroku.gif)
- However, to delete an appointment we pass the _id of the appointment, so that it will only be deleted.
